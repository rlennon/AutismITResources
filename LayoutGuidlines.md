Below are some guidlines as to how the website should be designed for the 
the intended audience.

Simple coulours should be used in the website a contrast ratio of 
4:5:1 should be used. This is for users who may be sensitive to high contrasts.
A simple means to avoid this is never to use pure black text on white backrouds, 
A grey or navy tone would be musch better. 

Clear plain language should also be used on the website, sayings for example should 
be avoied. for example instaed of saying it was raining cats and dogs the test 
should read it was raining very heavily. Uncommon words used in acedemia should also 
be avoided as some users may not nderstand them. For example words such as aggregate or coherant 
should be avoided in favour of more simple language. More examples of acedemic words some of 
which could be avoided can be found here:

Small sentences also help the readability of the website and the use of small paragraphs 
and bullet points make a big difference. 

Button links throughout the website should be very clearly descriptive as to what they do, 
this helps the user to know exactly what they are doing when navigating the site and as a 
result will reduce anxiety. 

lastly the layout of the website should be consistent, with the main factors being simplicity 
and seperation of diffrent website components.
