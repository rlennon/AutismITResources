<p>During the pandemic it is important for everyone to do their best to follow the government mandated guidelines to deal with this virus. Here we will outline the different steps you can take to 
  best mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Clean your hands often.</h3>
<p>One of the easiest, most useful ways of combating this virus is cleanliness. Make sure to rigurously clean your hands with soap and water as often as possible, particularly when you come back
  from leaving your home.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</h3>
<p>If you are in a public place and see someone coughing or sneezing it is best to steer clear. The person may just have a cough or cold, but it is better to be safe than sorry in this situation.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Wear a mask</h3>
<p>One of the most effective way of mitigating infection rates is wearing a mask. This not only protects you from potential infection, but also protects others you come into contact with.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</h3>
<p>The virus can be spread by eyes, nose or mouth so it is important to avoid touching these areas, particularly if you haven't washed your hands.
</p>
<br>


<h3>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</h3>
<p>Then dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Stay home if you feel unwell.</h3>
<p>Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others.

</p>
<br>

<h3>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.</h3>
<p>Call by telephone first, if you can and follow the directions of your local health authority.
