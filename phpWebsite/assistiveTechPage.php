                        Assistive technologies can be used to support and enhance communication for people with autism,
                        regardless of speech ability.

                    <p>
                        Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is a specific type of assistive technology that
                        can benefit people with autism of all ages by promoting independence, expanding communication,
                        and increasing social interactions. Read more from source

                        communication strategies (AAC) can provide them with an opportunity to express themselves and
                        have a voice.

                    <h3>How can assistive technology help a child on the spectrum?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Assistive technology can assist a child in comprehending classroom material in a way that he/
                        she can understand it. It can also help reduce the barriers your child may face that may prevent
                        them from being at the same level as his/ her classmates.
                        The process of determining the most appropriate assistive technology devices and services for
                        your child will begin with an evaluation. The evaluation can be conducted by your child’s school
                        or by an independent agency or consultant and should address both strengths and challenges that
                        your child possesses. Read more from source

                    <p>
                        Parents of kids with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) know that their children have important
                        things to say despite their difficulties with communication. Even nonverbal children with ASD
                        can be effective communicators when they’re given the right tools. Fortunately, research into
                        the use of technology by children with ASD shows that new high-tech tools can help kids to
                        express themselves and better cope with the challenges of their daily lives.

                        For many children with ASD, the biggest hurdle in dealing with the disorder lies in the realm of
                        communication. Read more from source
