      <p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and 
	  nonverbal communication. We know that there is not one autism but many subtypes, most influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Because autism 
	  is a spectrum disorder, each person with autism has a distinct set of strengths and challenges. The ways in which people with autism learn, think and problem-solve can 
	  range from highly skilled to severely challenged. Some people with ASD may require significant support in their daily lives, while others may need less support and, in 
	  some cases, live entirely independently. The content above and more can be found at this link: https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism
