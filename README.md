## Preamble

"What is autism: a devastating developmental condition, a lifeling disability or a natural form of cognitive difference akin to genius", excerpt from Neurotribes: The Legacy of Autism and How to think smarter about people how think differntly, by Steve Silberman. Let's hope that we can all learn to think differently and support each other.



This project aims to provid an online repository of resources for people with autism. Due to Covid they find that they suddenly a need to deal with new situations for which they many not have sufficient time to prepare. This student project requires the team to design a solution to enable appropriate resources to be provided to the customer. The duration allowed to work on this project means that it will not be fully completed. The design and a proof of concept should be completed with sufficient information to enable the next team to continue with the project.


Our product will be delivered using an Agile methodology that embraces the DevOps culture. Please note that our culture embraces change and these documents are treated as living, breathing artefacts that will be continuously updated.

    Unknown technology choices has led to a lot of upskilling required
    Changing / ambiguous requirements
    Talk of the company being bought out has raised concerns

## Social Contract

### Meetings

    Stand-ups will occur "<Tues & Thursday & Sunday at 4:00PM EST>".
    The order that people give their updates will be based on alphabetical order of those present at the meeting.
    Updates will be in the form: What I've done, What I plan to do, Impediments
    Sprint planning will occur every "<7 days>".
    Please add and update items within Jira prior to the sprint planning session.
    Sprint retro will occur "<First part of every sprint planning will review the previous sprint>", "5/21 at 7:00 PM EST>".
    The order that people present their sprint retro updates will be based on alphabetical order of those present at the meeting.
    Points raised in the sprint retro will be noted and posted on the slack channel by the Scrum Master.
    Backlog refinement?
    Task estimation will be done using <Time> 
    Come prepared to meetings.
    Be on time for Stand Ups and meetings.
    Mobile phones on silent.
    Everyone has equal voice and valuable contribution.
    Keep your language and tone professional at all times.

    Be honest.

### Communication

    Slack is the preferred method of communication.

    Jira will be used for task management and planning.
    Each member of the team will work "<10 hours>" per week, unless they are on vacation.

### Estimating Story Points Within Jira

The teams team's velocity is calculated by dividing the the number of points burned each sprint divided by no of sprints. The Velocity chart from Jira (below) is used for this calculation.

The teams current story point velocity is "<6>".  



Research and a working prototype with a sample maven java project with jenkins pipeline to compile the code and run unit tests have been created.
