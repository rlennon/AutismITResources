Proposing an autism friendly Colour scheme for the website

It is important to consider suitable colour schemes to provide a comfortable enviornment to the user. Research has found that several components of the eye are changed in Autistic children due to neural deficiencies and/or chemical imbalances. Some research has shown that almost 85% of children with ASD see colors with greater intensity than non-autistic children. Therefore is important to choose not only the right color but to limit the intensity of the shade.
Neutrals reduce visual stimulation, stay away from bright whites and any colors that might remind your child of a visit to the hospital or other facilities that your child might correlate with an unpleasant medical experience.

Children’s medical offices can often have an overload of primary colors including red, blue and yellow in their fullest intensity. Full intensity colors should be avoided.
Red should never be used in the home as children with ASD perceive the color as florescent.
Yellows likewise are very stimulating and are best to avoid.
Greens, blues, pinks, soft oranges and neutrals can be very comforting. Keeping the colors muted, these tones can quiet the mind and create calm. PPG has a special collection of Harmony colors that work wonderfully for this purpose. Here are some good choices broken down into paint color families.

Neutrals: Wheat Sheaf (PPG 14-21); Fishermen’s Net, (PPG 14-25) Armadillo (PPG 14-17) and Summer Wheat (PPG 14-10) are all excellent choices for a Neutral Color palette.

Greens: This is a winning color family. The eye does not distort green and it is very soothing. In the Dale, (PPG 11-10), True to You, (PPG 1118-3) Great Joy (PPG 1120-3) More Melon, (PPG 1116-2) and Lettuce Alone (PPG 1222-4) are nice, calm greens that represent a beautiful array of restorative colors. Misty Aqua, (PPG 1147-3) can also be fun and create a feeling of joy in children.

Blues: Blues should lean more towards the green and teal family. Although blue can be calming, too much or too dark can feel depressing. Colors like Simply Elegant (PPG1155-3) Crystal Lake (PPG 1151-4) and Magical (PPG 1160-2) may be more endearing to your child.

Pinks and Violets: These colors are very calming for children and evoke feelings of safety and love. On the violet side, shades like Misty Violet, (PPG 1247-3) and Frosted Lilac (PPG 1173-3) create a sweet and calming aura while soft pinks like Rose Blush (PPG 18-18) and Just Blush (PPG 18-17) are lovely, cleaner pinks. Rose Cloud (PPG1048-3) and Nostalgia (PPG1049-3) bring more mauve to the space.

Soft Orange and corals: It may seem counterintuitive to call Orange a calming color, but in the right tones, the color family can be very welcoming, warm and comforting. One bonus: using a soft orange or coral in the kitchen may help stimulate appetites and keep mealtime more manageable with picky eaters. Look to shades like Peach Beauty (PPG 18-27) and Beige Llama (PPG 18-13) to lean to the pastel- coral side of things while Peach Darling (PPG 1201-3) and Caramel Ice (PPG 1202-4) will put a nice warm glow in the room.

Minimizing the contrast is a key in placing color in these spaces. Paint the ceiling in the rooms a lighter version of that color to reduce the level of contrast between the ceilings and walls. Also, avoid using bright white trim around windows, baseboards and doors. The high contrast can create visual lines on the walls. It is perfectly acceptable to use the same shade of paint in a different sheen. For example, eggshell on the wall and satin on the trim. You could also go up or down one shade on the color stripe for the trim color. This will create subtle shading and look beautiful.

Avoiding extreme colours is also ideal as this can have a triggering effect for an autistic individual.

I would suggest for this website using muted versions of green and blue as they are soothing as well as visually appealing to the user.
